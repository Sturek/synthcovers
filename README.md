# synthcovers
DXF files for laser cut covers for synthesizers and similar gear. Cut out of felt for best results. 

## Working with the files

- red lines are meant to be engravings
- "with cutouts" is a second layer that can be glued on top
  - remove engraving from lower layer for this to look best
  - two 3mm thick pieces of felt work best, use contrasting colors for nice effects
